# employee-management-system

This project presents the development of an Employee Management System (EMS) using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and SQL for managing employee details. The system provides functionalities for creating, adding, deleting, and updating employee records efficiently.

The GUI interface built with Tkinter offers a user-friendly environment for interacting with the EMS. Users can perform various operations on employee data, such as adding new employees, updating existing records, deleting outdated entries, and retrieving employee information.

The system utilizes SQL for database management, ensuring robust data storage and retrieval. SQL queries are employed to execute operations like creating tables, inserting new records, deleting obsolete data, and updating employee details seamlessly.
